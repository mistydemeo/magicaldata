# About this project

This project contains my notes on the file formats used by [Magical School Lunar!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar:_Samposuru_Gakuen), released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn.

## About the game

Magical School Lunar! was released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn. It's a remake of Lunar: Walking School, originally released in 1996 for the Sega Game Gear. Both versions of the game were co-developed by Studio Alex (developers of the original Lunar: The Silver Star) and Game Arts. Neither version of the game was released outside Japan.

Magical School Lunar! is a prequel to the other two Lunar games, taking place a few hundred years prior to Silver Star.
