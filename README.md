# About this project

This project contains my notes on the file formats used by [Magical School Lunar!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar:_Samposuru_Gakuen), released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn.

For notes on the first Saturn Lunar game, [see this repository](https://github.com/mistydemeo/lunardata).
