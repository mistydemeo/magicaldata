# KANJI.FNT

## Description

Contains the game's dialogue font. Characters are stored as 16x16 tiles in 1bpp; while the game displays font characters with a black outline, that outline appears to be generated by the game and isn't stored in the font.

The font has a full set of hiragana and katakana and a large number of kanji, some special characters like a star and a heart, and a full uppercase English character set.

## TODO

The font begins at 0x0C48 into the file and runs until 0xD0A8. I haven't yet determined what the data outside the font is.
